          </h2>
          <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature. At this stage,
            no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
            signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
            DNT browser signals. California law requires us to let you know how
            we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is
            not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT
            signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
