          </h2>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Binding Arbitration</h3>
          <p>
            If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
            negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded
            below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding
            arbitration.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4 font-semibold uppercase">
            YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT
            TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
          </p>
          <p>
            The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
            Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
            ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures
            for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which
            are available at the American Arbitration Association (AAA) website.
            Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation
            shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate,
            limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by
            the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and
            expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
            submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will
            make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of
            reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow
            applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator
            fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable
            AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in
            Broomfield, Colorado.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Restrictions</h3>
          <p>
            The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the
            Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent
            permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other
            proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
            arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action
            procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute
            to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of
            the general public or any other persons.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">
            Exceptions to Arbitration
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
            above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes
            seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of
            the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related
            to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of
            privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive
            relief.

          <p>
            These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us
            on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire
            agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
            exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms
            shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These
            Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may
            assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any
            time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage,
            delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable
            control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal
            Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
            provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these
            Legal Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of
            any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership,
            employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a
            result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that
            these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of
            having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may
            have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack
            of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
